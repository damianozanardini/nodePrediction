    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the original description of the dataset. Clearly, **our goal is to set up a completely different prediction task**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph**: The ogbl-citation2 dataset is a directed graph, representing the citation network between a subset of papers extracted from MAG. Dach node is a paper with **128-dimensional word2vec features** that summarizes its title and abstract, and each directed edge indicates that **one paper cites another**. All nodes also come with meta-information indicating the year the corresponding paper was published.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction task**: The task is to predict missing citations given existing citations. Specifically, for each source paper, two of its references are randomly dropped, and we would like the model to rank the missing two references higher than 1,000 negative reference candidates. The negative references are randomly-sampled from all the previous papers that are not referenced by the source paper. The evaluation metric is Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), where the reciprocal rank of the true reference among the negative candidates is calculated for each source paper, and then the average is taken over all source papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset splitting**: We split the edges according to time, in order to simulate a realistic application in citation recommendation (e.g., a user is writing a new paper and has already cited several existing papers, but wants to be recommended additional references). To this end, we use the most recent papers (those published in 2019) as the source papers for which we want to recommend the references. For each source paper, we drop two papers from its referencesâ€”the resulting two dropped edges (pointing from the source paper to the dropped papers) are used respectively for validation and testing. All the rest of the edges are used for training."
